##### Have you noticed [this](http://https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) in JavaScript?
> `this` is an interesting thing (reserved keyword) in the JS world. It is simple and does what says - when you call a function it tries to know who is `this` trying to call me? üò¨


Here's an easy and simple example to start with üëáüèº

```javascript
const Dog = {
  food: 'Pedigree',
  eat: function() {
    return `I am eating my ${this.food}`;
  }
}

console.log(Dog.food) // Pedigree
console.log(Dog.eat) // [Œª: eat]‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã
console.log(Dog.eat()) // I am eating my Pedigree‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã
```
> JavaScript knows the context of the object and assigns `this` accordingly.

Great! now let's use this `eat` to for new custom Dog üê∂

Next, we will create a new object as `PedigreeLoverDog` and assign `eat` function of `Dog` object to it. üêï

```javascript
const PedigreeLoverDog = {
  eat: null
}

PedigreeLoverDog.eat = Dog.eat;

console.log(PedigreeLoverDog.eat()); // I am eating my undefined
```

ü§î `this` doesn't look good here - (pun intended üò¨)

A misconception someone here can have with `PedigreeLoverDog.eat = Dog.eat` is PedigreeLoverDog will have the access to `food` via `Dog`. But that's not the case.
üôá

 **Let's play around the concept here** üë®üèª‚Äçüíª


```javascript
const eat = function() {
  return `I am eating my ${this.food}`;
}

const Dog = {
  food: 'Pedigree',
  eat: eat
}

console.log(Dog.food) // Pedigree
console.log(Dog.eat) // [Œª: eat]
console.log(Dog.eat()) // I am eating my Pedigree
```

> Note: The 'eat' function is separated out but still is able to find the `food` on the Dog.

By default `this` will `bind` to the Object it's being called from. Doing `Dog.eat` makes `eat` ask for food from `Dog`.


```javascript
console.log(eat === Dog.eat) // true
console.log(eat()); //I am eating my undefined
```


Javascript will assign the scope of `this` to an Object preceding the dot(.) operator before the function call i.e `Dog.eat` from the example above and it is the reason when `eat` is called without `Dog`, makes 'this' lose the context. This is due to Implicit Binding in JavaScript üëá

##### **bind**ing

`bind` is what we need to use for providing scope to the `this` keyword.

When a function is referenced inside the Object - it has default binding to the Object calling it also known as Implicit Binding. This explains how inside `Dog#eat` gets to know `food` via `this`.

Note: `bind` is available on function and not the objects!


### Implicit Binding

When JS is not executed in strict mode, it binds the function to the Object making the function call - this behaviour is called Implicit Binding.

In the browser, the default binding for `this` is the `window` object. Check the example below:

```javascript
window.globalVar = 'I am a global';

var checkGlobal = function() {
  return this.globalVar
}

console.log(checkGlobal()) // I am a global
```

-------

### Explicit Binding

If you want to bind the function to a different object, it can be achieved using
 [function.prototype.bind](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind)


```javascript
console.log(eat()) // I am eating my undefined

console.log(eat.bind( { food: 'new food!' } )()) // I am eating my new food!
```

-----

##### **bind** with React

If you've been creating components in React and attached event listeners then you've probably come across this situation of using `bind` to the functions to pass the scope.

![bind-everywhere](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1IkJUZ8RHq7AROpvoH51UFcjZ0MZVvOYi&export=download)

```jsx
<button type="button" onClick={this.myHandler}>Hello</button>
```
> When using above code it will fail to do the desired operation and it needs a bind. Familiar?

> Blame `ES6`, not `React`.

ES6 introduced `class`. And now you can structure Components as Classes.

But a class uses `strict mode` and that sets the default value of  `this` to `undefined` instead of `window` or `global`.

When using React components with ES6 classes - make use of binding to provide `this` the context and not leaving it undefined.

Checkout behavior - "this" defaults to global but becomes `undefined` with "use strict" üëá

##### Arrow Function **=>**

One of the approaches to solving such issues is the usage of Arrow Function introduced in ES6. These functions have a default binding to `this`.

```jsx
class FooBar extends React.Component{
  myHandler = () => {
    console.log(this); 
  }

  render() {
    return(
      <button type="button" onClick={this.myHandler}>Hello</button>
    )
  }
}
```

##### Summary

- It does not matter if you declare the functions inside an object or outside of it. It's the scope of `this` that matters.

- Object calling the function is the default binding for a `this`. Also called as `implicit` binding.

- If the function reference is assigned to a variable, `implicit` binding will default to `global` in node & `window` in the browser environment.

- To change the scope of this, use `function.bind(object)` also called as `explicit` binding.

- ES6 classes work with `"use strict"` that prevents binding of `this` to the default scope.

- Make use of the Arrow functions to reduce the verbosity of `explicit` binding.
