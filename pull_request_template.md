- [ ] Set a due date on the Trello card
- [ ] Add proper labels (example: `Tech`, `Blog`) to the Trello card
- [ ] Raise a PR and assign reviewers to the PR. (Doing same on Trello card will also help as Trello sends auto reminder for the Due date).

- [ ] Copy + Paste the finalized content in Ghost
- [ ] Attach a right contextual image to blog post
- [ ] Have a proper SEO friendly slug to the blog post
